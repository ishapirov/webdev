<title> University of Georgia State Example on embedded style sheets</title>

<h1>Question 2</h1>
<p> The process I would use would be to have one linked style sheet which will contain
  the university standards for what the style of a webpage should be like. This will maintain
  consistency between different departments, as all of the departments will be using this linked stylesheet.
  Each department will still be able to make its own adjustments to style as needed through an embedded
  stylesheet. This is because an embedded stylesheet will take precedence over linked stylesheet, allowing
  each department to simply embed any specific format they wish within the html document. </p>
<h1>Question 3</h1>
<p>Some of the html tags needed are:</p>
<ol>
  <li> The h1 name class can be used for the name of the classes </li>
  <li> The h1 importantnews class can be used to notify the students of any important news related to the class. </li>
  <li> The h2 teacher class can be used for the name of the teacher</li>
  <li> The h2 exam class can be used to show the time and date of the next exam </li>
  <li> The h3 tag can be used to notify students of any assignments</li>
  <li> The p announcement class can be used to display any news the teacher wanted to show. </li>
  <li> The p description class can be used for the course description </li>
  <li> The course table class can be used to display the schedule for the class </li>
  <li> The student table class can be used to display the schedule of the student </li>
  <li> The p assignment class can be used to show the task of the assignment </li>
</ol>

<h1>Question 4</h1>
<p> Some of the important texts such as the due dates for the assignments and exams should be bolded and in a shinier color
  by using the font-weight and color style attributes. The table could be editted in many various ways, such as by coloring each row differently
  so as to make it easier for students to read the table. The font should be constant for most of the page and probably something formal such as
  Times New Roman, but if there is a more casual, fun assignment, then a more casual font like Comic Sans would be better. These can be implemented through
  the font-family attribute. The font size can be editted, but it is not completely necessary as the heading tags and paragraph tags already regulate the font
  size on their own. The student table should have alternating color columns instead of rows, because the columns would represent different days of the week so the week
  so the student would be able to clearly see which classes he has on which day. The table alternating row can be done by having a different background color of the tr:nth-child(odd)
  and tr:nth-child(even).
