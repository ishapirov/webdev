        <h1>How To Play:</h1>
        <div class="frosted ten-top">
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>The "Game of Life" is a zero-player game, meaning that once the initial input is received (i.e. the seed),<br/>
            the game begins and continues for an infinite amount of time without requiring input from the player.<br/>
            In this way, it's more closely related to a simulation rather than a game. </p>

            <br/>

            <h3>Rules</h3>
            <p>The playing board representing the game universe consists of a grid of cells, each of which can interact with its<br/>
            8 neighboring cells and exists in one of two states: <b>alive</b> or <b>dead</b>. Generations are based on the state<br/>
            of the previous universe. During the creation of each successive generation, individual cells follow this protocol:</p>

            <br/>

            <p>-> Any cell that is <b>alive</b> and has 2-3 neighbors that are also <b>alive</b> survives to the next generation</p>
            <p>-> Any cell that is <b>dead</b> and has exactly 3 neighbors that are <b>alive</b> becomes <b>alive</b> in the next generation</p>
            <p>-> Any other cell that is <b>alive</b> becomes <b>dead</b>; likewise, any other cell that is <b>dead</b> remains <b>dead</b></p>

            <br/>

            <h3>The Seed</h3>
            <p>This program contains several seed presets to choose from as well as a blank preset. For the blank preset, the player<br/>
            can choose individual cells to populate. After populating the playing board, the player can press "Start" to generate<br/>
            successive generations on a timed interval. Once the board no longer contains any populated (<b>alive</b>) cells, the<br/>
            game is essentially over.</p>
